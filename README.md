## About

Raze is a Compiled, Object Oriented, Statically & Strictly typed toy programming language that combines all the intuitive features from languages such as C, C#, and Python into a neat syntax, while also offering access to lower level programming.

## Syntax

Raze's syntax resembles other C-Family languages such as C and C#.

Example:

```py 

# Hello-World in Raze

```

```js

function Main(){
    Console.PrintLine("Hello, World!");
}

```
