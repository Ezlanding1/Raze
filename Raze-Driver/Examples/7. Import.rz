# The import expression will import Raze code from another file

# This line will import the Classes.rz file, allowing usage of its definitions. For example, you can use 'Classes.Student'
# import Classes;

# This variation of the import expression will import all the definitions from Classes.rz into the current context, allowing usage of 'Student' and 'Main'
#import * from Classes; 

# Since we only need the 'Student' class, the following syntax can be used
import Student from Classes;

# If you copy this code elsewhere, don't forget to bring 'Classes.rz' as well!

function Main()
{
    Student s = new Student(10, "John");
    Print(s.name);
}
